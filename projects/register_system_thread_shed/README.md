# Register System - Thread Shed

## Introduction
- Your daily responsibilities involve:
	- tallying the number of sales during the day
	- calculating the total amount of money made
	- keeping track of the names of the customers

## Description
 - Unfortunately, the system has an extremely outdated register system and stores all of the transaction information in one huge unwieldy string called daily_sales.
 - All day, for each transaction, the name of the customer, amount spent, types of thread purchased, and the date of sale is all recorded in this same string. 
 - Your tasks are:
 	- iterate string
 	- clean up each transaction
 	- store all the information in easier-to-access lists
