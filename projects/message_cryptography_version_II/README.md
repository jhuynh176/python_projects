# Decode Message I

## Introduction
- Caesar's Cipher was considered a very secure way of communication and it took a lot of effort to crack if you were unaware of the value of the shift?
- To test your cryptography skills, this next coded message is going to be harder than the last couple to crack. 
- It's still going to be coded with a Caesar Cipher but offset value is `Unknown`. 
- You'll have to `brute force` it yourself.

### Example:
- Encode message: `xuo jxuhu! jxyi yi qd unqcfbu ev q squiqh syfxuh. muhu oek qrbu je tusetu yj? y xefu ie! iudt cu q cuiiqwu rqsa myjx jxu iqcu evviuj!`
    - offset = Unknown
- Decode message:
    - `brute force` using offset from 1 to 26 until find an answer


## Description
- `prompt` user to select options
    - `decode`
    - `encode`
- `prompt` user to enter:
    - message to be decode/encode
    - offset number
- `brute force` using offset from 1 to 26 until find an answer


## Output
### Decoding
