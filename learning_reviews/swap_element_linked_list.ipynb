    "# **Swapping Elements in a Linked List**\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Learn how to swap two nodes in a singly linked list in Python.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Since singly linked lists only have pointers from each node to its next node, swapping two nodes in the list isn’t as easy as doing so in an array (where you have access to the indices). You not only have to find the elements, but also reset their surrounding pointers to maintain the integrity of the list. This means keeping track of the two nodes to be swapped as well as the nodes preceding them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a linked list and the elements to be swapped (`val1` and `val2`), we need to keep track of four values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `node1`: the node that matches `val1`\n",
    "- `node1_prev`: `node1`‘s previous node\n",
    "- `node2`: the node that matches val2\n",
    "- `node2_prev`: `node2`‘s previous node\n",
    "  \n",
    "Given an input of a linked list, `val1`, and `val2`, the general steps for doing so is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Iterate through the list looking for the node that matches `val1` to be swapped (`node1`), keeping track of the node’s previous node as you iterate (`node1_prev`)\n",
    "2. Repeat step 1 looking for the node that matches `val2` (giving you `node2` and `node2_prev`)\n",
    "3. If `node1_prev` is None, `node1` was the head of the list, so set the list’s head to `node2`\n",
    "4. Otherwise, set `node1_prev`‘s next node to `node2`\n",
    "5. If `node2_prev` is None, set the list’s head to `node1`\n",
    "6. Otherwise, set `node2_prev`‘s next node to `node1`\n",
    "7. Set `node1`‘s next node to `node2`‘s next node\n",
    "8. Set `node2`‘s next node to `node1`‘s next node\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Finding the Matching and Preceding Nodes*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at what implementing steps 1 and 2 looks like. In order to swap the two nodes, we must first find them. We also need to keep track of the nodes that precede them so that we can properly reset their pointers. (We will use the Node class’s `.get_next_node()` method in order to access the next node.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by setting `node1` equal to the head of the list, and then creating a while loop that runs while `node1` isn’t None. Inside the loop, we will check if `node1`‘s value matches `val1`. If so, we break out of the loop as we have found the correct node. If there is no match, we update `node1_prev` to be `node1` and move `node1` to its next node:"
