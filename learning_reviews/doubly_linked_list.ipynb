    "## **`Adding to the List`**\n",
    "In a doubly linked list, adding to the list is a little complicated as we have to keep track of and set the node’s previous pointer as well as update the tail of the list if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`Adding to the Head`**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a singly linked list, we can add to the head of the list by checking to see if it already has a head. We then either set the new node as the head (if there was no head) or update the head property, and link the past head to the new head.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a doubly linked list has an additional tail property and is built with nodes that each have two pointers, there are a few more steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by `checking to see if there is a current head` to the list\n",
    "2. If there is (meaning the list is not empty), then we want to reset the pointers at the head of the list:\n",
    "   - `Set` the current head’s previous node to the new head\n",
    "   - `Set` the new head’s next node to the current head\n",
    "3. `Update` the head property to be the new head\n",
    "4. Finally, if there isn’t a current tail to the list (meaning the list was empty):\n",
    "   - `Update` the tail property to be the new head since that node will be both the head and tail of the list\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`Adding to the Tail`**\n",
    "Since doubly linked lists have a tail property, we don’t have to iterate through the entire list to add to the tail like we did with a singly linked list. The new method will mirror what we did in our .add_to_head() method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by `checking to see if there is a current tail` to the list\n",
    "2. If there is (meaning the list is not empty), then we want to reset the pointers at the tail of the list:\n",
    "   - `Set` the current tail’s next node to the new tail\n",
    "   - `Set` the new tail’s previous node to the current tail\n",
    "3. `Update` the tail property to be the new tail\n",
    "4. Finally, if there isn’t a current head to the list (meaning the list was empty):\n",
    "   - `Update` the head property to be the new tail since that node will be both the head and tail\n",
    "\n",
    "## **`Removing from the Head and Tail`**\n",
    "Due to the extra pointer and tail property, removing the head from a doubly linked list is slightly more complicated than removing the head from a singly linked list. However, the previous pointer and tail property make it much simpler to remove the tail of the list, as we don’t have to traverse the entire list to be able to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`Removing the Head`**\n",
    "Due to the added tail property, removing the head of the list in a doubly linked list is a little more complicated than doing so in a singly linked list:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by checking if there’s a current head to the list.\n",
    "   - If there isn’t, the list is empty, so there’s nothing to remove and the method ends\n",
    "2. Otherwise, update the list’s head to be the current head’s next node\n",
    "3. If the updated head is not None (meaning the list had more than one element when we started):\n",
    "   - Set the head’s previous node to None since there should be no node before the head of the list\n",
    "4. If the removed head was also the tail of the list (meaning there was only one element in the list):\n",
    "   - Call .remove_tail() to make the necessary changes to the tail of the list (we will create this method in the next exercise!)\n",
    "5. Finally, return the removed head’s value\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`Removing the Tail`**\n",
    "Similarly, removing the tail involves updating the pointer at the end of the list. We will set the next pointer of the new tail (the element directly before the tail) to null, and update the tail property of the list. If the tail was also the head, the head removal process will occur as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **`Removing from the Middle of the List`**\n",
    "It is also possible to remove a node from the middle of the list. Since that node is neither the head nor the tail of the list, there are two pointers that must be updated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We must set the `removed node’s preceding node’s next pointer to its following node`\n",
    "- We must set the `removed node’s following node’s previous pointer to its preceding node`\n",
    "  \n",
    "There is no need to change the pointers of the removed node, as updating the pointers of its neighboring nodes will remove it from the list. If no nodes in the list are pointing to it, the node is orphaned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Doubly Linked Lists Review*\n",
    "Let’s take a minute to review what we’ve covered about doubly linked lists in this lesson. Doubly Linked Lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are comprised of nodes that contain links to the next and previous nodes\n",
    "- Are `bidirectional`, meaning it can be `traversed in both directions`\n",
    "- Have `a pointer to a single head node`, which serves as the `first node` in the list\n",
    "- Have `a pointer to a single tail node`, which serves as the `last node` in the list\n",
    "- Require the pointers at the head of the list to be updated after addition to or removal of the head\n",
    "- Require the pointers at the tail of the list to be updated after addition to or removed of the tail\n",
    "- Require the pointers of the surrounding nodes to be updated after removal from the middle of the list\n",
    "  \n",
    "*Your browser history is another example of a doubly linked list*. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you open your browser, the page that you land on is the head of your list. As you click on things and navigate to new pages, you are moving forward and adding to the tail of your list. If you ever want to go back to something you’ve already visited, you can use the “back” button to move backward through your list. Can you think of another computer use case for a doubly linked list?"

    "# **Node Class and Constructor**\n",
    "Now that we’ve learned about doubly linked lists, let’s implement one in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, a doubly linked list is a sequential chain of nodes, just like a singly linked list. The nodes we used for our singly linked lists contained two elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A value\n",
    "- A link to the next node\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between a doubly linked list and a singly linked list is that in a doubly linked list, the nodes have pointers to the previous node as well as the next node. This means that the doubly linked list data structure has a tail property in addition to a head property, which allows for traversal in both directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the nodes we will use for our doubly linked list contain three elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A value\n",
    "- A pointer to the previous node\n",
    "- A pointer to the next node\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the end-use of the doubly linked list, there are a variety of methods that we can define.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our use, we want to be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Add` a new node to the `head (beginning)` of the list\n",
    "- `Add` a new node to the `tail (end)` of the list\n",
    "- `Remove` a node from the head of the list\n",
    "- `Remove` a node from the tail of the list\n",
    "- `Find` and `remove` a specific node by its value\n",
    "- `Print out` the nodes in the list in order from `head to tail`\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we are going to look at the updated Node class and create the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ready? Let’s go!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We will reuse the `.stringify_list()` method from our LinkedList class, but we’re going to create the rest of the methods ourselves."
